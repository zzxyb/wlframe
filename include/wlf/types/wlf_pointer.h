 * @brief       Pointer input device type definition for wlframe.
 * @details     This file provides the structure definitions and functions for pointer input devices,
 *              including button, motion, axis, swipe, pinch, and hold events, as well as event signals
 *              for pointer actions. It supports multi-button, axis, and gesture input, and can be
 *              extended for device-specific data.
